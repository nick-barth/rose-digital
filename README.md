Built using my react/typescript/reactrouter/redux boilerplate which is based off of create-react-app.  I don't think any technology choices need mentioning, other than it's just vanilla css, normally I would use a preprocessor.  

My complaints are that I didn't use typescript to it's fullest, and my nav container got a little out of hand.  I think the design is weird as well, while it doesn't look terrible with 1 search results, 3 search results also gets a tad too big, that's why I did not go with a fixed layout for the navbar.  

To Run
```
npm install
npm start`
```
or 
```
yarn install
yarn start
```
