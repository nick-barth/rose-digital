Built using my react/typescript/reactrouter/redux boilerplate which is based off of create-react-app.  I don't think any technology choices need mentioning.  The redux store & routing weren't necessary for this coding challenge, however, my boiler made it easy and quick to implement them.  Other than it's just vanilla css, normally I would use a preprocessor.  

My complaints are that I didn't use typescript to it's fullest, and my nav container got a little out of hand.  I think the design is a bit strange, 3 search results also gets a tad too big, that's why I did not go with a fixed layout for the navbar.  As it would cover nearly the whole screen in mobile.  

To Run
```
npm install
npm start
```
or
